## A Chatroom Built with Websockets

The main purpose of this project was to experiment with websockets while integrating several different pieces of tech:

- ReactJS on the frontend
- Express on the backend
- PostgresQL to store user data
- AWS S3 to store images

## Requirements Capture:

Miro was used to create diagrams to outline the API design as well as frontend component architecture:
